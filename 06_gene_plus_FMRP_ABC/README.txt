06_gene_plus_FMRP_ABC contains code to produce plots in Figure 5 and S7. 

001_combined_ABC.ipynb produces the plots in 5C, D, E, H and S7A.

ABC_gene_stats.txt contains coefficient of variation per gene using the signal summations of H3K9me3 ChIP-seq signal across the FXS patient iPSC-NPCs for each NP BREACH gene using its TSS - 2kb upstream and + 10kb downstream, a Pearson rho for the gene alone with ABC, a Pearson rho for the gene and FMRP with ABC, and an associated q value.

bloodRNAseq_zscores.txt contains the blood RNA-seq data from Shah+, 2023 converted to z-scores.

BRAIN_BREACHes_genes_CV.csv contains the coefficient of variation per gene using the signal summations of H3K9me3 CUT&RUN signal across the FXS patient brain samples for each brain BREACH gene using its TSS - 2kb upstream and + 10kb downstream.
