09_mosaic_BREACH_genes contains scripts and code to produce plots in Figure S3 and S6. 

001_mosaic_brain_NPC_heterogenity.ipynb produces the plots in S3A and B; S6A and B.

mosaic_brain_BREACH_genes.txt contain a list of brain mosaic BREACH genes.
mosaic_NPC_BREACH_genes.txt contain a list of NPC mosaic BREACH genes.

genes_NPC_CV.txt contains the iPSC-NPC H3K9me3 signal data at genes, including the mean difference between FXS and NL, the z-score of CV for FXS samples and NL samples, computed separately, and NPC BREACH status.

genes_NPC_CV2.txt contains the iPSC-NPC H3K9me3 signal data at genes, but the z-score of CV for FXS samples and NL samples are computed together.

genes_brain_CV.txt contains the brain H3K9me3 signal data at genes, including the mean difference between FXS and NL, the z-score of CV for FXS samples and NL samples, computed separately, and NPC BREACH status.

genes_brain_CV2.txt contains the brain H3K9me3 signal data at genes, but the z-score of CV for FXS samples and NL samples are computed together.
