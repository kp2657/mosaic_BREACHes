04_qRT_PCR_iPSC contains code to start with qRT-PCR and H3K9me3 data for SLITRK4 and SLITRK2 in ML_scClones 1-7 outputs to produce plots in Figure 4.

2024_05_01_qPCR_replicates.csv contains the qRT-PCR data.
qPCR_H3K9me3.csv contains the qRT-PCR averages as well as the H3K9me3 CUT&RUN signal summation at each gene, -2kb from TSS to +10kb from TSS.

001_ML_scClones_qPCR.ipynb produces the plots in 4B,C,F.
